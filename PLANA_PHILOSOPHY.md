# PlanA Philosophy & Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

PlanA is built for the Nigerian gig economy - high-speed, zero-theory, project-based learning that gets you earning fast.

### The Three Pillars

1. **Zero Theory** - Every lesson builds something real
2. **High-Speed** - 4-12 week intensive cohorts
3. **Gig-Ready** - Skills for Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, and local clients

## Design Principles

### 1. Project-First Learning

❌ Traditional: "Learn HTML, then CSS, then JavaScript"
✅ PlanA: "Build a landing page (you'll learn HTML, CSS, JS along the way)"

Every course is a real project:
- Landing pages for businesses
- E-commerce stores
- Mobile apps
- Marketing campaigns
- Design portfolios

### 2. Speed Metrics

Track what matters:
- Time to first deliverable
- Projects completed per week
- Client-ready portfolio pieces
- Gig platform profile strength

### 3. Nigerian Context

- Data-efficient video streaming
- Offline-first design
- Local payment methods (Paystack, Flutterwave)
- Naira pricing
- Local business examples
- Nigerian success stories

### 4. Gig Economy Focus

Replace academic language:
- "Course" → "Project"
- "Lesson" → "Task" or "Step"
- "Assignment" → "Deliverable"
- "Grade" → "Client Rating"
- "Certificate" → "Portfolio Piece"
- "Instructor" → "Mentor"

### 5. Portfolio-Driven

Every project becomes a portfolio piece:
- Live demo link
- Case study write-up
- Client testimonial (simulated)
- GitHub repository
- Behance/Dribbble showcase

## Content Structure

### Course Format

```

├── Week 1: Setup & Foundation
│   ├── Task 1: Set up tools (30 min)

```

### Lesson Format

Each task includes:
1. **What You'll Build** (30 seconds)
2. **Quick Demo** (2 minutes)
3. **Build Along** (main content)
4. **Your Turn** (practice)
5. **Submit** (get feedback)

No theory lectures. No "Introduction to..." videos.

## UI/UX Principles

### Color Usage

- **Orange (#FF6B35)**: Primary actions, progress, success
- **Blue (#2E5EFF)**: Secondary actions, information, links
- **Solid colors only**: No gradients (faster rendering, clearer hierarchy)

### Typography

- Clear hierarchy
- Mobile-first sizing
- High contrast for readability
- Nigerian English spelling

### Components

- Fast-loading cards
- Skeleton loaders for perceived speed
- Optimistic UI updates
- Offline indicators

### Mobile-First

- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Bottom navigation for key actions
- Swipe gestures
- Data usage indicators
- Download for offline

## Messaging Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- Direct and action-oriented
- Encouraging but realistic
- Nigerian context and examples
- No corporate jargon

### Examples

❌ "Complete this module to enhance your understanding"
✅ "Build this feature to add to your portfolio"

❌ "This course covers fundamental concepts"
✅ "This project gets you client-ready in 4 weeks"

❌ "Assessment: Multiple choice quiz"
✅ "Deliverable: Working website you can show clients"

## Success Metrics

Track learner success by:
1. **Speed**: Days to first portfolio piece
2. **Quality**: Client-ready deliverables
3. **Earnings**: First gig secured
4. **Portfolio**: Live projects deployed
5. **Skills**: Verified through real work

## Instructor Guidelines

### Creating Content

1. Start with the end project
2. Break into weekly milestones
3. Each milestone = portfolio piece
4. No theory-only lessons
5. Every video shows building something

### Feedback Style

- Specific and actionable
- Focus on client perspective
- Suggest portfolio improvements
- Connect to gig opportunities

### Example Feedback

❌ "Good work. Grade: B+"
✅ "This looks great! To make it client-ready: 1) Add mobile menu, 2) Optimize images for faster loading. These changes will help you win more gigs."
